# Leave Form using JavaScript | Take-Home Test
Hi!

This is the form that I created for the take-home test that you have given to me.
#
The whole process is can be showed at the JavaScript since it is the required for creating this form. 

There are also comments on the parts of the code that explains the process in order to know what will be the process in the specific line of codes.

I also add some css styles to make it presentable when reviewed.

I deployed in order to not just read the code but also test it for the user experience.

To view the source code of this form, below is the link of repository in my Github.
